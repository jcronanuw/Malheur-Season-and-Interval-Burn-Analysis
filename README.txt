Purpose: data management and analysis necessary to test hypotheses regarding how surface fuels behave over time and effects of environmental and treatment variables (i.e., season-of-burn and fire frequency).

Data Summary: This analysis looks at a long-term dataset. Project was initiated in the late 1990s as a forest pathogen study but was extended and broadened over the following 5-6 years to function as a long-term experiment and to include fire frequency (initially season-of-burn was the only treatment. There are two treatments, each with two factors, and a control. Each was randomly assigned to six replicates all in mature Ponderosa pine stands on the Malheur National Forest.
Treatments
1. Season-of-burn
  a. Spring
  b. Fall
2. Interval
  a. 5 year
  b. 15 year
